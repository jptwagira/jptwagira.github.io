My primary research interest has been to identify sources of astrophysical neutrinos using data from Neutrino Telescopes. My PhD research focused on the performance studies of the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment (P-ONE) using Monte Carlo Simulations. This includes producing the first detailed event Monte Carlo simulations for the P-ONE, developing event reconstruction algorithms for the P-ONE, conducting statistical data analysis to forecast the sensitivity of the P-ONE to point sources of astrophysical neutrinos, and optimizing studies for the P-ONE.

I defended my PhD thesis and I am obtaining a PhD in Physics in May 2026 at Michigan State University. I hold Master of Science in Physics in 2020 from Michigan State University. Before joing MSU, I obtained a Master of Science in Mathematical Sciences from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in 2018 and Bachelor’s degree from the University of Rwanda in 2015.
